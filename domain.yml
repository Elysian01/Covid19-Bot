  utter_medicines:
  - text: No pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective
      for the treatment of COVID-19.
  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
      predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS,
      and COVID-19
  utter_corona_distance:
  - text: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others.
      Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets
      from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you
      can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has
      the disease
  utter_corona_symptoms:
  - text: The most common symptoms are <br><br><b>Fever</b></br><b>Dry cough</b></br><b>Tiredness</b><br><br>
      And Serious Symptoms are <br> <br><b>Difficulty Breathing</b></br><b>Chest Pain</b></br><b>Loss
      of speech or movement</b>
  utter_prevent_corona:
  - text: Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include frequent
      cleaning of hands using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; covering the
      nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or disposable tissue when coughing and sneezing;
      and avoiding close contact with anyone that has a fever and cough.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The
      first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading
      from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can
      happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while
      other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from
      person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the
      illness to others. That is why we recommend that these patients be isolated
      either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they
      are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.n How long someone
      is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation
      is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention
      and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics
      of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and
      results of laboratory testing for that patient.n The virus that causes COVID-19
      seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”)
      in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected
      with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they
      became infected.

  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease.
